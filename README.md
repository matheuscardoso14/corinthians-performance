# **Corinthians' performance in the 2024 Brazilian Soccer Championship**

## Overview
This is a project that tells a little about how Sport Club Corinthians Paulista has performed in their national soccer championship: Brasileir√£o, how we're accustomed to call it in Brazil. This project has three files:

- **A Python script** that scrapes a website about soccer statistics. This script will get data about all the matches that Corinthians has played and save them as a .csv file.
- **A .csv file** (generated by our previous script) with all the data about the matches. This file has five columns:
    - **Date**: the date when the match has been played.
    - **Home**: the home team.
    - **Goals_Home**: goals scored by the home team.
    - **Goals_Away**: goals scored by the away team.
    - **Away**: the away team.

- **A Jupyter Notebook**, where the data are manipulated and used to plot two charts:
    - **A pie chart**, comparing the number of wins, defeats and draws.
    - **A stacked vertical bar chat**, comparing the number of wins, defeats and draws by month, from April to December.
